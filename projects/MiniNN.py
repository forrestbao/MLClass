#    MiniNN is a simple neural network library crafted by Forrest Sheng Bao 
# at Iowa State University for students to hack to understand NNs. 
#    MiniNN is deveoped because the source code of scikit-learn.neural_network 
# or Flux was too long to study and not easy to hack. Not to mention the
# complexity of source code of Tensorflow or PyTorch for teaching intro to ML.
#    With MiniNN, students can easily see gradients on all weights between 
#  layers during training and visualize every layer, and tweak around.

#    Under 200 lines, it covers all core operations of NNs: 
# feedforward, backpropagation, and gradient descent. 
#    To be mini and simple, it supports only logistic/sigmoid activation,
# cross entropy loss, and updating the NN with one sample each time. 
# Preinitialized transfer/weight matrixes are needed to intialize the network. 

# Feel free to use it in your teaching or playing.
